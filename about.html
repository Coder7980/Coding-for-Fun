    <h1>About Our Buisness</h1>
    <p>In Art But Upside down we offer lessons to learn how to make art upside-down. We do our classes twice a week on Tuesday and Thursday, and they will last about 2 - 3 hours. It will cost $2 for your first
        lesson, and every one after will cost $5. But if you buy more lessons like the $5 and the $10 deal, you can save some money! And don't worry, if you think that you won't do good because you're not that
        good at art, learning how to make art is all part of the fun! So come join us sometime on our upside-down journey. </p>
